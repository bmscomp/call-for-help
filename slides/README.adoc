= Slides for Call for help

This repo contains slides for the talk "Back to Front".

Slides sources are in `src/main/asciidoc` directory, images are in the `src/main/resources/images` directory.

These slides are generated using https://docs.asciidoctor.org/reveal.js-converter/latest/[Asciidoctor for Revealjs].

It generates a Revealjs html file `slides.html` with embedded images in `target/generated-docs` directory.

== Building slides

Slides can be built with Ruby or with java and Maven.
The Ruby generation is more efficient and provides hot generation while Java is here for people that don't want to mess with Ruby (and prefer mess with Java)

=== Ruby

You need a ruby runtime with version 2.3 or more installed.
If you need to install Ruby you can check the https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/[offcial website]

Then install bundler


`gem install bundler`


And download the dependencies

`bundle update`

and use the local script to render the slides

`./render.sh`

you can also use live render that automatically updates the result when you change source

`./liverender.sh`

generated file will be here:

`target/generated-docs/slides.html`

=== Java And Maven

You need both Java and Maven installed.

just type:

`mvn`

generated file will be in standard maven target:

`target/generated-docs/slides.html`

=== Hot reload

Slides include a livereload script that will automatically reload the browser when you change the source file.
In order to use you need to browse the file through a local webserver like the one include in intellij or other IDE.
